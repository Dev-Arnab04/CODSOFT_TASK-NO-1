            "Plot: 52951 ::: Cheryomushki (1963) ::: The title of the film (literally \"Cherry Town\") refers to new towns or neighborhoods based on middle-class urban development, where every block of houses looks exactly the same as the next. In the Soviet Union of the late 1950s this was thought to be equivalent to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This musical involves the tribulations of four couples whose lives humorously intersect. It opens with Sergei, a driver, meeting up with his good friend Boris. After lamenting being alone, Boris falls head over heals for a museum guide, Lida. She resists his advances but that doesn't stop Boris. She leads him to her friends, Masha and Sasha, who are planning to get married and are elated to have recently received permission to move into an apartment in the Moscow Cheryomushki. On her way home (with Boris constantly tagging along), Lida discovers along with her father that the roof of their apartment has collapsed and is now uninhabitable. After some amazingly quick work, they receive permission to move into the same Cheryomushki. Working as a steam shovel engineer at this Cheryomushki is Lyusya, who is Sergei's girlfriend. She also has just obtained an apartment there and is waiting to hear the question that Sergei is too shy to ask. Sergei takes Boris, Lida, and her father to the Cheryomushki, ignoring the job for which he was hired, being a taxi to Vava, a Fellini-esque no-nonsense but playful buxom woman and her husband, Drebednev. Drebednev is the corrupt real estate manager who gives (or more often doesn't give) permission for people to take an apartment in the Cheryomushki. Additionally, Vava is a friend of Boris. To make Vava happier, Boris convinces Drebednev to expand their 2-bedroom apartment into a 4-room apartment. But when he breaks down the walls, he has to evict the tenants in the next apartment, Lida and her father. They are heartbroken and have to now worry about going through the long process of receiving another apartment. Meanwhile, as Masha and Sasha move in, they discover that none of their neighbors have keys, so they all spend an evening of singing and dancing in Masha's and Sasha's apartment. Realizing Lida's plight, Boris suggests to Vava that two 2-bedroom apartments are better than one 4-bedroom apartment. Drebednev returns the aparment to Lida and her father, is unmasked as a bureaucrat, and Vava chooses to get a divorce. Finally, through the help of a bench, Sergei gets the courage to ask Lyusya to marry him. In the end of the film, Lida still rejects Boris, who is one of the crewmen detonating Drebednev's old office. He picks the petals of a daisy (\"she loves me, she loves me not\") when the detonation goes off, thrusting him up several floors on to Lida's terrace, and presumably to a happy end for all.\n",

George's wife, Alice, tries to cheer him up by taking him to a party of artists, but it turns out to be a gaudy, pretentious affair that leaves both of them dispirited. After a restless night, George wakes up to find himself gazing with newfound fascination at the Picasso reproductions that adorn the walls of their apartment. Overcome with admiration for a truly brilliant artist, George impulsively proposes that he and Alice fly off to the south of France to track down Picasso and thank him in person. Alice agrees, thinking the trip will prove a delightful lark. But George's desire to find Picasso turns into an obsession that starts to take a toll on their seemingly ideal marriage. San Francisco based architect George Smith is dissatisfied with his professional life, especially after his company completes design of a large development project, in which his small contribution - a big, square, empty warehouse - he was not even allowed to include a washroom. As George, a former art school student, is inspired by the works of 'Pablo Picasso (I)' (qv) who looks at the world in his own way, George convinces his wife, Alice Smith, that they expand on what was supposed to be only his one week off following completion of that project by traveling to France for as long as it takes to find Picasso so that they can just say thanks to him for the happiness he has given them. Locating Picasso and actually being able to speak to him may be two totally different matters. Based on advice from Picasso's friend 'Luis Miguel Dominguín' (qv), George goes to extreme lengths to achieve his goal. The larger questions are whether this trip will reinvigorate George's life especially if the Smiths aren't able to meet and speak to Picasso, and what will happen to their marriage, especially as this quest is more George's than Alice's.\n",

Adolescent siblings Alexander and Fanny Ekdahl lead a relatively joyous and exuberant life with their well-off extended paternal family, led by the family matriarch, their grandmother, Helena Ekdahl. The openness of the family culture is exemplified by Helena's now deceased husband ending up becoming best friends with one of her lovers, a Jewish puppet maker named Isak Jacobi, and their Uncle Gustav Adolf's open liaison with one of the family maids, Maj, who everyone in the family adores, even Gustav Adolf's wife, Alma. Between the siblings, Alexander in particular has inherited the family's love of storytelling, his parents and his grandmother who are actors and who manage their own theater. Things change for Alexander and Fanny when their father, Oscar, dies shortly after Christmas 1907. Although she truly does believe she loves him, the children's mother, Emilie, decides to marry Bishop Edvard Vergérus, who she first met as the officiate at Oscar's funeral. She also wants a father figure for the children. Going into the marriage, Emilie has inclinations that it will be a much different life than she had with the Ekdahls, but is not prepared for the harsh, austere and strict life Edvard rules with an iron fist. Emilie, Alexander and Fanny end up being prisoners in the bishop's stark and humorless house. As Alexander butts head with his stepfather and tries to learn how to keep to his own principles while obeying Edvard, Emilie tries to figure out a way to regain her and her children's own destiny, as Edvard will not consent to divorce, and her \"desertion\" in the eyes of the law means that Alexander and Fanny would become his wards. Alexander Ekdahl and his younger sister Fanny live a wonderful life. Their parents own a local theater and the extended Ekdahl family are close, spending Christmas together. Just a few weeks after the Christmas celebrations however, their beloved father dies. The children and their mother feel the loss greatly and Alexander occasionally sees his father's spirit in the house. After a period of time, their mother informs them that she is to be married to Bishop Edvard Vergerus, someone Alexander had already encountered over a lie he once told at school. The Bishop's house is a dreary place and the Bishop proves to be a strict disciplinarian who insists on all house rules being followed. After being caught in another lie, Alexander is severely beaten and his mother realizes she must find a way to send the children away. The title characters are children in the exuberant and colorful Ekdahl household in a Swedish town early in the twentieth century. Their parents, Oscar and Emilie, are the director and the leading lady of the local theatre company. Oscar's mother and brother are its chief patrons. After Oscar's early death, his widow marries the bishop and moves with her children to his austere and forbidding chancery. The children are immediately miserable. The film dramatizes and resolves those conflicts. A sub-plot features Isak, a local Jewish merchant who is the grandmother's lover and whose odd household becomes the children's refuge.\n",

            "Plot: 52985 ::: Cedar Rapids (2011) ::: Tim Lippe (Helms) was the guy people always thought would go places but then he just ... didn't. He's been living in über-sleepy Brown Valley, Wisconsin his whole life, still \"pre-engaged\" to his 7th grade teacher Macy Vanderhei (Weaver), while selling insurance to protect other people's dreams. But now, Tim's stalled life is about to get a kick-start because, for the first time in his 34 years, he's headed to a \"major\" metropolis - Cedar Rapids, Iowa - where he must try to save his company at a do-or-die insurance convention that, for him, will be entirely unconventional. From the minute he checks into his hotel with his ancient American Tourister and cummerbund money belt, it's clear Tim has no idea how the modern world really works. He is soon smitten with seductive Nebraskan insurance agent Joan Ostrowski-Fox (Heche) and awed by his experienced roommates, the straight-shooting Ronald Wilkes (Whitlock Jr.) and the suspicious Dean Zeigler (Reilly). Disheartened when he comes face-to-face with corporate corruption, Tim is ultimately lured beyond the lobby into an urban jungle he's only ever seen on DVD and when it seems his life - and chances to succeed - have gone completely topsy-turvy, he finds his own unjaded way to turn it all around. Tim Lippe has led a sheltered life in Brown Valley, Wisconsin, and thus has a simplistic view of the world, he liking the comfort of knowing everyone he comes across in his small town daily life. In his naive view, he believes his once weekly sexual encounters with Macy Vanderhei, who was his seventh grade teacher now recently divorced, is true love on both their sides. He loves his job as an insurance salesman for Brown Star Insurance, owned for twenty-five years by Bill Krogstad. Tim truly tries to do what's best for his clients. Brown Star has done well as a company largely because it has won the American Society of Mutual Insurers' (ASMI) Two-Diamond award three years in a row, it awarded only to one agency a year based on private presentations made by competing agencies to the ASMI president, Orin Helgesson, at ASMI's annual convention in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. On behalf of Brown Star, those winning presentations have been made by the agency's wunderkind, Roger Lemke, who Tim and everyone else in their office truly admires. Brown Star's winning streak is threatened when just before the upcoming ASMI convention, Roger dies under somewhat shady circumstances. His death not only means that he won't be making the presentation this year, but those shady circumstances, which if they came to ASMI's attention, would taint Brown Star's reputation as ASMI has a strong Christian morality at its core. Bill decides to send Tim to the convention as Brown Star's representative despite Tim feeling non-confident in heading to the big city to fill Roger's big shoes. At the convention, Tim is ill-prepared to deal with the people he meets, from the three conventioneers with who he ultimately hangs - Dean Ziegler, Joan Ostrowski-Fox, and Ronald Wilkes - to Bree, the young woman loitering in the convention hotel parking lot, she who he is naively unaware is a hooker. They are all outside his mentality of that comfortable Brown Valley life. As Tim spends time with this group, he will have to come to some decisions about his life, including how far he is willing to go to make it four in row for Brown Star and what his decision means in a holistic sense to him.\n",

From the Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields\" to Black Sabbath to Kanye West, Mellodrama is a 50-year odyssey of musical invention, revolution, betrayal, and rediscovery. The Mellotron is a keyboard instrument that plays prerecorded tape loops. It was invented as the Chamberlin organ in Harry Chamberlin's Southern California backyard in the late 1940s. Harry wanted to sell his \"orchestra at your fingertips\" to every Aunt Mable in America, and drove his motor home across America doing so. But his trusted salesman Bill Franson took two instruments to England, and found manufacturers to replicate the Chamberlin. Under this dubious pretense, the Mellotron was born. Soon, through the music of the Beatles, the Zombies, and the Moody Blues, the Mellotron became the \"instant magic sound.\" In the 1970s, the Mellotron defined the sound of progressive rock bands like King Crimson, Roxy Music, and Genesis. Though forgotten during the 1980s, when digital synthesizers hijacked pop music, the Mellotron is today again a highly desired and sought-after device, a connection for artists like Radiohead and Kanye West to the mystical lost world of invention and possibility.\n",

Music and singing is one of her passions, one of the ways she stays connected to the memory of her musician mother. Kassie stumbles upon an injured and abandoned German Shepard, who, with Esther's help, nurses him back to health while hiding the fact of who they eventually name Scoot from their father, who they believe will not let them keep him. But upon finding out about him, Paul does allow them to keep Scoot, who Kassie considers her first real friend in Heber Valley. Kassie is eventually able to use music in the form of the children's choir at the local church to find her place in town. She and the other choir kids mobilize their talents to raise money for the Toys for Tots Christmas charity, donations which were in short supply due largely to the fact of there being no snow in a town that relies on winter tourists. As the donations, which are being kept in a locked glass box in the middle of bank, increase, Kassie and her friends are unaware of two things. First, the two security guards Paul just hired are really criminals who plan to rob the Toys for Tots donation box.

Jews and Muslims, either from Arab or Berber origin, are generally proud of Morocco's diversity. But around 50 years ago, an irreparable break tore apart Morocco's social fabric. In addition to the sufferings provoked by French colonialism and years of authoritarianism under the former King Hassan II, the foundation of the state of Israel and its need for Jewish immigration had huge consequences on Morocco's Jewish community. The Israeli intelligence infiltrated Morocco to scare Jews into leaving their homeland, arguing that Muslims were a threat for them. Today, Morocco's once thriving Jewish community has only around 2000 members left. Through the lives and testimonies of Fanny, Pinhas, David and Vanessa, we revisit this troubled and often taboo period of history. The characters tell us about why they decided to come back to Morocco, a country that could be an example of religious cohabitation for today's disintegrating Middle East. Fanny once left Casablanca illegally to Israel, and ended up being a human rights activist in France. Pinhas left his Berber village as a child and never really recovered from the separation: wasn't Morocco his true homeland after all? David never left and made a fortune by buying real estate from departing Jews. Vanessa's family left Morocco 200 years ago. Today, she moved from the United States to Casablanca to research and sing traditional Moroccan Jewish music. But life is not always easy for them in Morocco. Indeed, the Arab-Israeli conflict makes it harder for Moroccan Jews to define their place in the Kingdom. However, Muslims and Jews alike are committed to preserve Morocco's Jewish memory, an indelible element of Morocco's society.\n",

The outline of a human figure is briefly visible, though long enough to form a trail for the viewer's gaze, which somewhat unsteadily probes the wavering lump. this trail leads to the inspiration for einar's computer animation: an image of the human body. einar, an ensemble of animation artists, uses live footage of a human body to extract, a single image at a time, the outline of an animated two-dimensional image. The visual grammar of the live footage, i.e. the alteration of the focal length, the camera angle and editing techniques, give the virtual bodies their shape. The bodies are used to translate temporal length into spatial depth. Though the Cartesian conception of the body, according to which it occupies a certain amount of three dimensional space, is applied, this presence is exclusively temporal in timebased_body. In the flow of time, the (two dimensional) contours of the human body fade and take on fascinatingly irritating forms in a fictitious space. (Robert Buchschwenter)\n",

After returning to Earth NASA's Orion spacecraft is seen from an unpiloted aircraft descending under three massive red and white main parachutes and then shortly after its bulls-eye splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, 600 miles southwest of San Diego. During the uncrewed test, Orion traveled twice through the Van Allen belt, where it experienced periods of intense radiation, and reached an altitude of 3,600 miles above Earth. The spacecraft hit speeds of 20,000 mph and weathered temperatures approaching 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it entered Earth's atmosphere. It was the first real launch test for a new generation of manned space vehicles from Cape Canaveral in decades. The United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket, with NASA's Orion spacecraft mounted atop, lifted off from the Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 37 at 7:05 a.m. EST, Friday, Dec. 5, 2014, in Florida. The successful launch was Orion spacecraft then orbited Earth twice, reaching an altitude of approximately 3,600 miles above Earth before landing in the Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft is designed to allow humans to journey to destinations never before visited including an asteroid and Mars. In a TV first -NASA's Ikhana unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was used to capture live video of the Orion splashdown for NASA TV and broadcast around the world. The aircraft's camera, mounted on the plane's underside, will generate a live video feed of the descent. Ikhana was acquired by NASA in November 2006 to support Earth science missions and advanced aeronautical technology development. While Ikhana loitered at 27,000 feet altitude, the infrared camera detected the earthbound capsule and allowed the aircraft camera operator to switch to an optical camera and observe Orion's descent through parachute deployment and splashdown.\n",

According to Cindy, Elvis sent her on this mission when he rose out of the waters of the mighty Willamette River, surrounded by rays of sunlight, appearing in a vision, just as the Blessed Mother Mary herself appeared to Bernadette. Her intentions are pure, Cindy insists. She is not out for money and fame, she states, emphatically defending herself when Dan raises the question. \"Don't Be Cruel,\" Justin sings, aware that he was adopted, but how can he not be to Cindy, whose mission and message seem impossibly far-fetched. Cindy is sure her ex-neighbor Gloria is his mother. Gloria said so. Gloria always played Elvis' music and collected his memorabilia and had a romantic story to tell about Elvis in Vegas. However, Dan went on the Internet and found 76,483 women who said they'd slept with Elvis. And a number of them claimed Justin was their son as well.

Through interviews with former FBI Profilers, Cultural Academics, and Film Historians the documentary delves into the disturbing history and myth of Snuff Films. The FBI claims there is no evidence to prove the existence of Snuff and, therefore, Snuff Films are a myth. This documentary analyzes the relationships between war, cult films, serial killers and pornography to prove whether or not this pervasive myth is, in fact, reality. Without a doubt, one of our time's most controversial and unique urban legends is that of the elusive snuff film: a shocking form of video explicitly showing the real death of a human being. But do these films really exist or are they, in fact, a myth? With this in mind, through interviews from a handful of analysts, experts, FBI officers and former police detectives, this documentary attempts to shed light on a rather obscure topic, defining its various types in five general sections. As a result, this bold documentary leaves space for the viewer to make his own choice, but in the end, whether the snuff film exists or not is debatable; the real horror is that we are all encircled by death in our modern societies, and that is a certainty.\n",

Charlie can provide anything for anyone, whether it be answers for the upcoming biology exam, instructions on how to win prom queen, the best place to take a girl on a date, or just an ear willing to listen. Wielding an uncanny amount of power for a 17-year-old, Charlie is able to traverse the myriad high school cliques by remaining perfectly neutral, offering his services to anyone. Jock and punk, nerd and cheerleader, goth and valley girl - everyone knows Charlie, and Charlie knows everything about them. Or so he thinks. Charlie's facade of neutrality starts to crack as the students he helps begin to deal with problems more mature than their high school experience has prepared them for. Rising tensions between competing groups erupt in aggressive conflicts, and though Charlie has the power to stop these confrontations he chooses to watch from the sidelines. Caught in the middle of violent events he has set in motion, Charlie is forced to make a choice: hold on to his precious neutrality, or get off the fence and help his friends. A modern interpretation of how the church in Laodicea looked when John wrote \"Because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.\" (Rev. 3:16), \"Hello, My Name is Charlie\" examines how every decision - even seemingly trivial high school choices - has a moral consequence.\n",

She's open and mischievous. He's guarded and practical. Differences lead to interest, however, as Charly finds depth in Sam's idealism and Sam seeks the vibrance of Charly's joie de vivre. But all is not smooth in the Rockies as their relationship accelerates - cultural differences, family issues, former loves and life-altering challenges threaten to shake things up. Adapted from Jack Weyland's best-selling novel Charly, the film is at times light-hearted, at times soul-searching, and above all a thoughtful journey of love, of laughter... and of hope.\n",

Set in Okhahlamba, South Africa, a stunning, mountainous Zulu area and UNESCO World Heritage Site, the story follows Danisile and Ntombeleni, two women with full-blown AIDS as they attempt to access recently introduced antiretroviral (ARV) treatment through the public sector. Danisile responds well to the medications, with the support of her family and her volunteer nurse. Ntombeleni does not respond as positively, experiencing the delirium and difficult side effects that are a strong source of controversy within the Zulu culture. The universal aspects of motherhood and the struggle to survive are explored through the womens' lives: Danisile's strained relationship with her teenage daughter, who secretly fears becoming one of South Africa's 1.2 million AIDS orphans, and the traditional Zulu ceremonies that Ntombeleni's family holds to combat her illness in their own way. Illustrating the bittersweet reality of the situation, through both the miracle of survival and the tragedy of falling victim to an overwhelmed medical system, Thing With No Name reveals the private and public obstacles that have led to an out of control epidemic.\n",

They set off up a narrow mountain track between bushes and boulders. Ropes appear - a safety measure, and shortly thereafter the climb takes them into a dark, narrow and wet tunnel in a cliff. There, feeling their way forward and groaning they go up and down in a never-ending rocky gorge accompanied by the threatening sound of falling stones. It should be said that here the framework and conditions (which are difficult to make out), distort towards the grotesque. After this intended exaggeration they do manage to escape into the open air and events immediately take a conventional turn - the men arrive at a mountain lodge complex where they begin servicing a long-distance telephone box situated there. (Dabernig/Scherer) To some extent Dabernig / Scherer identify with one of their protagonists who, in spite of a physical handicap, does not allow anyone to help him on the steep climb which is, in addition, exceptional and, one could say, strangely old fashioned operation. But, just as this Post Office employee never loses his countenance as chauffeur or later as hiker, the film makers never slip into the trap of simple pleasantries. This is not a visual joke, although it always threatens to tip over and neither is it a culturally pessimistic contribution to current communications and globalisation traps. What is most arresting in Timau, as in the case of Dabernig's Wisla is the art of the moment. Normally the deeply private loneliness of the opening car journey would be at the end of a great melodrama (well, OK it could also be a small melodrama).\n",

He's manages to pay the bills and then some as the self-described \"world's greatest erotic photographer,\" a moniker that rings more hollow every time it comes out of his mouth. Which it does, often. Awash in drugs and alcohol Stewart's lost all zest for life. He's watched over by his beleaguered wife, Donna (Ursula Brooks), who's started to wonder why she stays. Even his models, jaded from years of working in porn, are beginning to tire of him. To help Stewart, Donna hires young art school student Wade Ward (Shaun Sipos) to photograph him for his autobiography \"The World's Greatest Erotic Photographer, Ever!\" Desperately broke, Wade takes the job but finds his dependence on Stewart for income corruptive. Matters further complicate when Wade falls for Queenie (Zoë Hall), Stewart's conflicted new model who has her own demons to dance with. Wade takes a dim view on the darkly comical proceedings as Stewart races to what may be his final bottom, he drags along a reclusive alcoholic neighbor (Dee Wallace), a lonely detective (Lew Temple), his lascivious assistant (Josh Marchette) and finally Donna who's possibly had enough after all. Redemption may be right around the corner. It's just not for everybody. Once a rock star photographer, Stewart Fox's years of drug and alcohol abuse have relegated him to shooting erotic photos of model/actress wannabes out of his home to make ends meet. In a desperate attempt to get back into the spotlight, he hires a struggling art student to turn the camera on him for a self-published autobiography. But with so many sordid stories and complicated characters pressing buttons all around him, eventually something is bound to snap.

The narrative revolves around how a creation of the sculptor- an idol of Ma Durga punishes him (by rendering him indisposed and idle), when he crosses all limits of abuse and shows him a life of yearning. The film concludes with a deep dawn of realisation - of how a single action- takes away from him his ability to be a prolific sculptor- that of clay and stone and that of his child's future. The film is embedded with contrasting symbolism, as aptly reflected in its title, most strongly that of the strength of a woman, of a mother, which is - representative in Ma Durga's rendition of 'Good over Evil'. The hunger for food, the hunger for physical fulfillment and the hunger for creativity are natural, necessary and common human instincts. However, an unbalanced, excessive and uncontrolled desire to fulfill one's hunger leads to dire consequences, which is the story of The short 'Living Idle'.\n",

Acknowledging the scientific consensus on the issue, the debate will steer clear of the pointless \"skeptics vs. alarmist\" angle and focus on what we can do as individuals, a nation and a species to avert the impacts of climate change. Attenborough's film lays out seven components of a sane response to global warming - strategies and targets from the household to big industries and government. But each one has implications, and many - like a growing reliance on nuclear power - are highly contentious. Our goal is to debate these strategies in a positive and constructive spirit: combating the paralysis of swirling fears with concrete ideas for informed action.\" But in retrospective, in 2006, Attenborough did not have enough scientific evidence to be more blunt. So, the author of this review simply summarizes the situation of year 2011 as following: Pollution, eating species into extinction and massacre of environment happens on global scale: sacred and very needed by life on Earth trees are being massacred by human predator. Gold mining, illegal tree cutting, illegal ranching in Amazon already destroyed a lot of sacred trees. Films: \"AMAZON with Bruce Perry\", \"The End of the Line (2009)\".

While some achieved their dreams of stardom, others ended up in independently produced short films in which these nubile would-be actresses were asked to throw their modesty - and clothes - to the wind. These movies were meant to catch the modern woman in her most private moments - performing household chores, dancing to the latest twist record, or working on her tan - all of which, it seems, was better done in the nude.

The contestants would then have to guess whether or not a celebrity's answer was right. Contestants guessing correctly would gain control of the square. Gaining control of three squares in a row would win the game. Updated version of the classic game show of Star bluffs (Zingers) and tick-tack-toe. But this time hosted by John Davidson. As before, the object was to win a standard game of tick-tack-toe by correctly agreeing or disagreeing with a star's answer to a question (The Directions are Across, Up & Down & Diagonally.) The 9 Stars were seated in a 3 X 3 tier (a la tick-tack-toe board); they were joined by 2 contestants--1 a returning champion (one competing as the \"X\" for Men & the other \"O\" for Women). The contestant chose a star on the square for which host Davidson read a general knowledge question. Correctly agreeing or disagreeing allowed that player to place their \"Xs\" & \"Os\" in that box; an incorrect answer meant the opponent's \"Xs\" & \"Os\" was placed there, unless it led to tic-tack-toe in which case the opposing contestant had to earn the box. During the 2nd game of each show is a \"Secret Square\" game offered the contestants a bonus prize (usually a trip) for a correct answer. The (1st 2) games on each show were worth $500 and Later in Season 1 with future games worth $1000; if an undefined time limit expired during a game in progress, the contestants won $100 (Later $200) for their own marks after the \"Car Horn\" sounded.

However, it would not be until the 21st century when this same man, no longer a boy, would discover with his sister an absolutely worthless cheat-code that probably nobody remembers besides the developers. A cheat known as...Hatman, a pudgy, minimally designed stick figure, decked out with a slanted hat and a stationary 'H' on his white, smooth belly. A cheat that appears by typing in the name, and a cheat that suddenly takes over anything that moves on screen. Known as 'wireframe' mode in some circles. Likewise, the developers of this game were bound to be the only people on the planet who actually knew not only Hatman himself, but the story behind it. From that day on, Glaser grew determined to get to the bottom of this thing that absolutely nobody cared about or wanted to know, and he sought out to get there quickly and efficiently. Within a few months, he had tracked down a handful of the developers, and yes...the very men who brought Hatman into this world. Oh, and possibly most importantly...the man himself that Hatman was based off of. A hermit of a man who involuntarily became the focal point of the documentary itself...overshadowing even his titular doppelganger in the process.\n",

We will take the science out of laboratories and telescopes and bring it to your more familiar worlds: the mountains, valleys, barren landscapes and cities. The rules that hold the universe together will be presented by exciting and crystal clear experiments. The wonderful colours that fill the darkness of the universe will be shown through spectacular CGI. Scientific research and curiosity will be our compass and \"Universe for Beginners\" will be a one-of-a-kind TV experience for its audience. \"Universe for Beginners\" is a brand new series from the producers of \"Time Machine\".\n",

The host would give a word to one of the teams, then the celebrity had to come up with the association recorded by the contestant prior to the show {e.g.: Cut-\"SCISSORS\"}. If the celebrity guessed correctly in 3 tries or less, the team earned 10 points. If not, the celebrity from the opposing team could guess once for a chance to \"steal\" 10 points. Otherwise, The Word Revealed with the 1st Letter and deducted by 1 point until next-to-the-last letter for 1 point until the star to buzz-in say the word. The 1st team to earn 100 points and collects $100 won the game and played a bonus round called \"The BIG 5\". In this round called \"The BIG 5\", the contestant left the stage and entered a soundproof room while the celebrity named 5 associations in each 1 of the 5 words or theme provided by the host. The celebrity would then designate 1 as the bonus word, the 1 contestant was most likely to come up with. Once this was completed, the contestant returned and had 20 seconds to come up with all 5 words with these associations earning $50 for each one. Originally, if the contestant merely named the bonus word, they would double their winnings in the bonus round up to $500 in 10 seconds. To provide a greater degree of difficulty a rule was subsequently added requiring the contestant to guess the bonus word in order to double their winnings. For the second game, the celebrities changed sides. Contestants can play until defeated or reach $1200 in cash. On December 23-27, 1968... \"SNAP JUDGMENT\" is formatted to \"PASSWORD\". Now the Game gives 10 clues to the word for 2 teams or less wins 10 points for the 1st chance and all the way the 10th and last chance clue worth 1 point. After the 5th Word, The Points are doubled.

Henry's Full House\" is a film divided in five segments telling five tales in the beginning of the Twentieth Century. 1) \"The Cop and the Anthem\": the winter is coming and the homeless drifter Soapy wants to go to jail for three months to get shelter and food. His partner Horace suggests they look for shelter with the Salvation Army, but Soapy refuses. He forces many situations to be arrested but he is always forgiven. When he goes to the church, there is a miracle and Soapy decides to seek a job position. Will he succeed? 2) \"The Clarion Call\": when a thief kills a man, the police investigators do not have any lead to follow. Police Sergeant Barney Woods sees a pen that was found in the crime scene and he seeks out a man called Johnny Kernan. He finds Johnny that invites Barney to drink with him and they go to his hotel room. Johnny recalls their youth, when they were friends but Barney tells that he must arrest him since he recognized the pen that belonged to Johnny. However the criminal recalls that Barney owes him $ 1,000 that Barney lost in a card game. Barney unsuccessfully tries to raise the money to quit the debt. He decides to tell to the Chief of Police but out of the blue, he sees the spotlight on \"The Clarion Call\" and and runs to the newspaper. What did he see? 3) \"The Last Leaf\": When the lover of the twenty-one year-old Joanna Goodwin breaks up with her, she wanders on the snow and gets pneumonia. Her older sister Susan Goodwin finds that Joanna does not want to live anymore and is following the leaves that keep falling from a tree. Their upstairs neighbor, the painter Behrman, tries to help the girls the best he can. Will he be able to save Joanna? 4) \"The Ransom of Red Chief\": the con men Sam 'Slick' Brown and Bill Peoria flee to the countryside in their car and plot to kidnap the boy J.B. Dorset to ask for ransom to his parents. But soon they find that the boy is a little devil. 5) \"The Gift of the Magi\": In Christmas Eve, Della and her beloved husband Jim are penniless and in love with each other. Jim dreams on giving a tiara to Della since she has a wonderful hair and Della wants to give a chain to the pocket watch of Jim. On the Christmas night, they find a way to buy the gifts. Five O' Henry stories, each separate. The primary one from the critic's acclaim was \"The Cop and the Anthem\". Soapy tells fellow bum Horace that he is going to get arrested so he can spend the winter in a nice jail cell. He fails. He can't even accost a woman; she turns out to be a streetwalker. The other stories are \"The Clarion Call\", \"The Last Leaf\", \"The Ransom of Red Chief\", and \"The Gift of the Magi\". John Steinbeck introduces five of O. Henry's most popular short stores in this anthology film. In \"The Cop and the Anthem\" a homeless alcoholic is increasingly frustrated in numerous attempts to get arrested and jailed for 90 days in a warm cell rather than face the rigors of a New York winter. In \"The Clarion Call\" a NYPD detective has a crisis of conscience when he is torn between his duty to arrest a childhood friend for a murder only he knows he committed and the debt of honor he still owes to him. In \"The Last Leaf\" a naive young girl is stricken with pneumonia after being seduced and jilted by venal actor. When she loses her will to live, her devoted sister and an eccentric Greenwich Village artist try to help her to survive. In \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" two bumbling con men kidnap the son of a rural sheriff for ransom but find they've taken on more than they can handle. Finally, in \"The Gift of the Magi\" an impoverished but devoted young couple struggle to pay for Christmas gifts worthy of their mutual love.\n",

The complexities of life with colorful characters in the refugee transit camp and nearby kibbutz makes it hard to reconcile their real lives with their deeper dream of still finding the Newland. We found this movie lacking any compassion. The characters in it seem to just be wondering around without any purpose - the plot is simply shallow and lacked focus. The two main characters the brother and sister who arrived from Poland are portrayed as very close to each other. However the brother, who is older, ditches his sister for a tempting offer to join the Kibbutz. He returns back to her when the sister puts things back in perspective about their past together. Really? I find it hard to believe that two sibling who are close and survived the Holocaust would so easily part after what they have been through. Sure, he did attempt once to bring his sister on board but when that failed she literally became none existant to him. The movie ends with the brother and sister seeking another new land after they are fed up with their mistreatment.

The peaceful protest and show of solidarity by the miners escalated into a scene of violence and destruction when the miners were met by police and warned to turn back. Pushed to the limit by beggarly wages, raising families in tar-paper shacks, working in poorly ventilated underground shafts with rotting timbers, frequent cave-ins and high concentrations of carbon monoxide, the miners lashed out. Violence turned to gunfire with the arrival of RCMP reinforcements. Eight miners and four bystanders were wounded. Three miners were shot dead. Emotions ran high.

Ex-military man Jim Field, married with three high school aged daughters, wants to portray having the perfect, loving family to the outside world, which is anything but reality largely based on his behavior and thus relationships with the other family members. While trying to be what he considers the model father, he cheats on his wife and is a bit of a blowhard. A prime example of his behavior was several years earlier canceling a family vacation to Disneyland impromptu in favor of a two week nuclear attack simulation, taking the family to live during that time in the locked bomb shelter in their backyard. His wife Mary, a former dancer, suffers from chronic clinical depression, exacerbated by family events including her relationship with Jim. Regardless, Jim truly has a protective attitude toward her. She spends most of her time in a semi-comatose state in front of the television while the girls help her self-medicate with alcohol. Each of the girls tries to deal with their family dysfunction in different ways. Norma, the Plain Jane self-conscious one who truly wants a loving relationship with her parents the most of the three, tries to hold the family together in maintaining the house while secretly harboring family memories which no one else in the family will talk about. Lou has always been the rebellious one, she most openly showing her anger toward her father, who she considers a tyrant. In her own world, Sandy models herself after the typical 1950s housewife. The girls' perspectives are affected by their encounters with one person apiece who enters their respective lives. Norma is befriended by perky Stella, a new girl in her class and neighborhood who seemingly could have any friend she wanted. Despite telling others she thinks he's weird, Lou, in her rebellion, pursues Tom, a new classmate, an anti-America ex-American hippie. And Sandy's first customer at the seamstress shop where she has just started working is thirty-eight year old married shoe store owner Reg Shelman, who makes no bones about his sexual interest in her. In addition to these encounters, the family members are forced to face their family dysfunction head-on following a tragic event in the early hours of New Years Day 1970. The wickedly funny story of three sisters' coming of age in a wildly dysfunctional family, set against the backdrop of the 60's, free love, the Cold War, LSD and the dawn of feminism. Affectionately dubbed \"Little Women on acid\", this is a story about the destructive effects of secrecy and the bonds of duty between parents and their children.\n",

The story of Ivan Allen's life and career is one of transformation. A child of the new Southern gentry, he inherited his father's business fortune and political aspirations. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia on a segregationist ticket in the 50s. Later that decade, as the head of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, he found himself up against a strong anti-segregation protest movement, emanating from the Atlanta University Center of historically black colleges. After defeating avowed, sometimes violent segregationist, Lester Maddox, in the 1961 mayoral election, Ivan Allen led the desegregation of city government buildings. In his two terms as mayor, Atlanta became the headquarters of the Civil Rights Movement, and the city grew as much as all the previous years since its founding. The mayor's often rocky journey through the tumult of the 60s offers a fresh perspective on today's climate of division and polarization. By opening himself up to the diversity of voices around him, Ivan Allen managed to bring together a divided city, and pave the way for Atlanta to become a hub in the world economy. His legacy is not that of a hero, but rather that of a flawed person who was willing to lead by compromise. These stories are vital to share with today's Atlantans, many of whom know little of its history.\n",

When his long-time friend and client, Ohio senator Sam Hastings, decides to quit politics, he is rapidly drafted to help with the campaign of the man destined to succeed him, unknown and mysterious businessman Jerome Cade. In parallel, and unaware of the potential dangers, he proceeds to unravel the mystery surrounding Hastings dropping out, with the aide of his ex-wife, a prominent Washington-based journalist. But interests more powerful than local arm wrestling are at stake, and things start going awry. Pete St. John, assisted by his right hand woman Sydney Betterman, can command a high price for his services due to his success as a freelance political campaign strategist. He generally doesn't care about the political stripes of his clients, he only caring about getting the job done which will ensure his continuation in the business. Pete used to work for Wilfred Buckley until a professional disagreement led to Pete deciding to start his own consulting business, Wilfred who is now a friendly rival for the same pool of clients. During what is a midterm election year, Pete has among his clients: Washington Governor Andrea Stannard who is being attacked by her main opponent for her personal home situation rather than her politics; wealthy New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Wallace Furman, whose main obstacles to an election night win are not being a native New Mexican and having little personal charisma; and Roberto Cepeda, a Presidential candidate in a strife and violence-ridden but oil-rich South American country. Pete, however will not be working on the campaign of his friend Ohio Senator Sam Hastings, who is retiring due to an undisclosed serious health issue. That retirement leads to Pete being sought out by political neophyte Jerome Cade, who is looking to win Hastings' vacated seat. Cade portrays himself as a newer version of the popular Hastings except for one fundamental difference. Pete was approached to work on Cade's campaign by Arnold Billings, who operates his own PR firm with Cade one of his clients. Through this election season, Pete has several encounters with his ex-wife, investigative journalist Ellen Freeman as she works the politics beat. The issue which she believes doesn't pass the smell test is the reason for Hastings' retirement. Pete and Ellen divorced not because they didn't love each other, but because their respective jobs left them little time to have an actual relationship. Through this election cycle, Pete may get a different perspective of his work and of his clients in particular, especially when he learns that an unknown someone is monitoring his every move without coming right out and telling him so.\n",

They have a modest yet elegant apartment in Santiago's old downtown district complete with a lovely terrace and mountain views. Well into their 80's, they both maintain their independence and live happily with their books, their eclectic art, and most of all with their beloved two ample cats. That is until, one day, the building's elevator breaks and unable to descend the ten flights down, Isadora is left a prisoner in her own home. At the same inconvenient time, Isadora's passionate \"wild child\" daughter Rosario (Claudia Celedon) and her butch female lover, Hugo, (Catalina Saavedra) come for a visit with a new \"scheme\" of how to make them all rich. The one glitch is that the elderly couple must sign over the lease to their apartment. The tug of war between mother and daughter escalates when Isadora, beginning to show signs of onset senility, has a near dangerous adventure and bravely journeys down ten flights and onto the crowded Santiago streets. Once rescued, mother and daughter and their respective spouses begin the slow process of forgiveness and begin to see a new future.

Isidora, an old woman, discovers that her mind is quickly deteriorating. At an apparently relaxed dinner table, she will desperately try to hide her state from her daughter, a demanding woman who awaits any sign of senility in order to take way everything she has.

Diana was an enigma: the most pre-eminent female celebrity of her generation, a fashion icon, an image of feminine beauty, but also a high-profile campaigner on AIDS issues and a committed opponent of landmines. During her lifetime, she was the most photographed person in the world, quickly becoming an iconic presence on the world stage. But although Diana, Princess of Wales, was noted for her pioneering charity work, her endeavours were sometimes overshadowed by her tempestuous and controversial marriage to Prince Charles. Her death in Paris on August 31st 1997 was one of the most shocking events of the 20th Century. To her admirers, the Princess of Wales was a role model; and after her death some called for her to be nominated for sainthood. But her detractors saw her short life in the goldfish bowl of the world's media as a cautionary tale of how an obsession with publicity can ultimately destroy an individual. On the fifteenth anniversary of her death, this new feature programme celebrates the life of Diana, Princess of Wales and draws upon previously unseen archive and new insights since her death to piece together a portrait of the most iconic woman of the twentieth century. With personal and insightful contributions from royal biographers and correspondents, Princess Diana: A Celebration is a timely retrospective of a unique woman and her impact on the world.\n",

The rules to this 1970s five-day-a-week syndicated series were identical to those in the classic ABC series. Four couples, each married less than two years, answered a series of questions designed to expose how well the spouses knew (or didn't know) each other. The husbands were first to answer the questions while their wives were secluded offstage; many times, the answers involved \"whoopie\" (a euphemism for \"sex\"). Matching answers were worth 5 points each, while not matching usually led to high-pitched arguments much to the delight of Eubanks and the audience. The process was repeated with the wives answering a series of questions and the husbands taken backstage, correct answers were worth 10 points. A final bonus question (usually general, answered by the wives) was worth 25 points. The couple with the highest point total at the end of the game won a bonus prize \"chosen especially for\" them usually a trip, furniture or mode of transportation (other than a car or truck). Reruns of \"The Newlywed Game\" remains among the highest-rated shows on the Game Show Network. An updated version of the long-running game show, still with veteran host Bob Eubanks. Newlywed husbands and wives would take turns answering (often risque) questions while their spouses were backstage. After answering, the spouses would return and be asked the same questions, earning points if their answers matched their spouse's. The couple that finished with the most points would win a prize.\n",

After that, the winner plays a bonus round where they attempt to get another three in row without accidently picking the screen with a dragon that will cost them their bonus game winnings. In the update of the 1956 TV series, two players (one a champion) competed in a variant of tic-tac-toe, trying to get three of their mark in a row by answering general knowledge and pop culture questions. Tie games meant playing subsequent games (sometimes leading to large jackpots) until someone won. Champions played a bonus game, where they chose from nine numbers on the Tic Tac Dough board. Getting $1,000 (by uncovering dollar amounts ranging from $100 to $500) or revealing both words TIC and TAC won the player a $1,000-$1,400 bonus plus a prize package; uncovering the dragon at any time prior to reaching $1,000 lost everything.

A group of starving, but young and willing, actors band together to share finances and an apartment.

Or, to phrase it more precisely, a intellectual-existential wank about sex and life - or rather failure in life. An emotionally broken Polish director - the excellent Malga Kubiak, herself an actor-director of sexually graphic movies in real life - gathers a bunch of German wannabe actors in a remote bungalow deep in the forest. The obsessive director, an increasingly tyrannical psycho-maniac, wants total commitment from her actors to her movie, i.e., wants them to have real sex before the camera. She chose German actors because she thought Germans didn't have any problem with nudity. But the cast rebels. They don't mind playing sex, but don't want to do it for real on camera. The director - whose suggestive forlorn beauty is that of a retired porn star - doggedly sticks to her idea, inflexible in her demands. The whole experience turns into a sheer disaster for everyone. A big joke, with hilarious scenes of failed sex that conveys a sense of absurdity close to Gogolian despair.\n",

Based on one specific game winning incident on the college football field, somewhat feckless Harold Diddlebock is offered a job by E.J. Waggleberry at his advertising firm after Harold graduates from college. Harold believes this offer will set him up for life. After Harold graduates, Waggleberry does offer him that job, an entry level accounting one from which Harold believes he will quickly climb the corporate ladder. Fast forward twenty-two years to 1945: Harold is still in that entry level job. Waggleberry fires him due to his ineptitude. Harold is not as much disappointed in his professional career, or lack of one, than he is in no longer seeing on a day-to-day basis Miss Otis, a graphic artist at Waggleberry's with who he is in love. Each of Miss Otis' six sisters had her job before her, and Harold loved each of them when they had the job, something all seven sisters knew and know.

Bianca accepts and promises to send for Rose as soon as possible. In Paris she meets Etienne Du Inette, head of the Internationale, a powerful secret service organization. He and Bianca are instantly attracted to each other. Jules Lavinne, also in the service of the Internationale, goes to Corsica on a secret mission. He sees and desires Rosa. One day a mysterious veiled woman slips a note under Etienne's door, warning him to go to Corsica and watch Lavinne, who is a traitor. He soon has occasion to protect Rosa from Lavinne. Lavinne learns the assumed name Etienne is using on the island and signs it to a note asking Rosa to meet him. In Paris, Bianca finishes and exhibits her first piece of work, and it is purchased by a wealthy patron. She sends for Rosa, but a letter from old Maria tells of the girl's disgrace and attempted suicide. Bianca rushes to her sister, who is dying. She finds the note which lured her sister to her destruction. It is signed, \"Pierre Renard.\" Bianca vows to follow Pierre Renard \"To the Death.\" She meets Jules Lavinne, and instinctively dislikes him, but when she learns that he belongs to the Internationale she forces herself to be gracious to him, hoping that he will aid her in finding \"Pierre Renard.\" Lavinne, determined to win her, avoids meeting Etienne. Bianca asks Lavinne's aid, and he promises to find the man for her if she will marry him. Having vowed to avenge her sister at any cost, she promises. That night Lavinne telephones that he has a photograph of Pierre Renard. Bianca asks him to bring it to her at once. Before he comes he writes a note which he instructs his man to deliver to Etienne. It reads, \"Bianca is in great danger. Go to her at once.\" Lavinne engages tickets on the midnight train, and tells his valet to take his portmanteau to a prominent hotel, where he arranges to have a priest ready to perform the ceremony. He shows Bianca the photograph. She is speechless with horror when she sees that it is a picture of Etienne. Lavinne instructs her to ask him whether he was not known in Corsica as \"Pierre Renard.\" When he arrives she does so, and he admits it, also admitting that he knew Rosa there. She plunges a dagger in his breast, and he falls to the floor. Unwilling to keep her bargain with Lavinne, she attempts to take her own life. Lavinne prevents her, and forces her to accompany him to the hotel where the priest is in waiting. No sooner is the ceremony performed than Lavinne boasts of having won her by trickery, saying that it was he himself who lured Rosa to her death by the use of the name \"Pierre Renard.\" Just then the valet knocks at the door, and Lavinne admits him. Behind him follow the woman of mystery and two gendarmes. The woman is Lavinne's wife, and he is arrested as a bigamist and a traitor. He returns to Bianca the dagger with which she struck down her lover. She rushes back to her own apartment, to kill herself beside his body, but she is amazed to find him gone. Her old nurse leads her into the room where he is lying asleep. The medallion of herself worn over his heart has saved his life.\n",

These performances of artistic activism started in Brazil in the end of the 1970s, as part of the re-democratization process during the final years of the military dictatorship (1964-1985). At that historical moment, any agglomeration of people in a public space could be considered as a potential target of political repression. The population was therefore forced to always remain inside private spaces, what created a culture of confinement. In recent years, initiatives of urban interventionism have increased exponentially, being encouraged by democratic public administrations. The grayish city of Sao Paulo is the stage for this series. Through ludic and socially responsible performances, these artistic collectives use the public space as a means to stimulate the population to reoccupy a territory which has always belonged to them: the streets. The series accompanies a group or collective that sees the street as a space for art, creativity and communication. These urban interventions are defined as 'artistic activism'. Each episode brings a reflection of the various forms of re-signifying the public space, through the shooting of ludic and socially responsible propositions.

            "Plot: 53919 ::: The BQE (2009) ::: Sufjan Stevens is proud to present The BQE, a cinematic suite inspired by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Hula-Hoop. Commissioned by Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), The BQE was originally performed in the Howard Gilman Opera House in celebration of the 25th anniversary Next Wave Festival in October of 2007. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is an incidental 12.7 miles of urban roadway built over the course of several decades (1939-1964), spear-headed by the master architect Robert Moses to accommodate for the increase of commercial and commuter traffic in New York City's outer boroughs. The roadway was a painstaking piecemeal project, poorly planned, badly built, and relentlessly encumbered by the obvious obstacles of the era: red tape, neighborhood protests, World War II, and a congested borough whose sequestering layout proved ill-fitting for the automobile. The resulting expressway-a pockmarked, serpentine, congested BQE-has become one of Brooklyn's most notable icons of urban blight. And, for Sufjan Stevens, an object of unmitigated inspiration. The official album release of The BQE follows nearly two years after its original performance at BAM, providing the songwriter (and his various collaborators) ample time to wrestle out all the thematic incarnations of the project, and to attempt an appropriation of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total work\"). The resulting album might be best described as a grand creative franchise-incorporating movie, symphony, comic book, dissertation, photography, graphic design, and a 3-D ViewmasterŽ reel-in which a songwriter's interrogation of one of New York's ugliest landmarks expands athletically to forums and formulas outside of the song itself. In fact, the BQE is everything but a song. First and foremost, The BQE is a self-made home-movie documentation, exhibiting how all the architectural colors of Brooklyn and Queens are fabulously intersected by this ramshackle artery of highway traffic. Shot renegade style on do-it-yourself film cameras, the animated footage of grid-lock crisscrossing the brick and mortar of Brooklyn flickers and cascades Koyaanisqatsi-style on three simultaneous screens. The 16mm cinematography (heroically shot by Reuben Kleiner on a 1960s Bolex) utilizes time-lapse photography, in-camera editing, slow motion, and post-production mirror effects to transform urban blight into a splendor of graphic compositions. The BQE is also accompanied by an idiosyncratic musical soundtrack (composed by Stevens for band and chamber orchestra), evoking a romanticized musical choreography of perpetual motion vs. gridlock. Borrowing variously from Gershwin, Terry Riley, Charles Ives, and Autechre (to name a few), the music showcases skittish woodwinds wrestling out impressionist articulation (in 7/8) and imperial brass anthems evoking various incarnations of the music of the automobile. Further Information: The BQE is available as a double-disc format (CD/DVD), which includes the original 16mm/8mm film (in widescreen \"triptych\" display), the original motion picture soundtrack, a 40-page booklet (with extensive liner notes and photographs), and the stereoscopic image reel\n",

This documentary follows nine National Guard soldiers from Oregon who ended up in some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Most of the photographs and footage were taken from the cameras of the soldiers themselves giving the viewer rare access to the front lines in places such as Fallujah, Najaf and the desolate IED infested roads outside of Baghdad. Joking while a sniper shoots at them or griping about \"higher command's\" decision- making processes, these soldiers come across as distinctly American. Of the nine soldiers covered in the documentary, two are severely injured in combat and several more are wounded in action. Through it all they retain their bond to each other. Powerful and hard hitting, this film puts the war into a context that watching the evening news simply can't do. It's honest, brutal, funny and always engaging. This is War.\n",

The first team to score $300 (later $500) won the game and played \"Alphabetics.\" In \"Alphabetics,\" 10 passwords were given one at a time, each beginning with a successive letter of the alphabet (e.g. A through J). The contestant won $100 per correct guess, with a $5,000 prize for getting all 10 passwords within 60 seconds (a progressive jackpot was later added).

Despite leaving Roxy Music in 1972 Simpson is still described as \"The best bassist Roxy ever had\". And who to this day has still not been replaced by Ferry. Even over 40 years later, this self-described \"Young-upstart\" is still longed for by Roxy Music fans globally - who cite his \"Melodic bass lines\" as being a \"Key ingredient\" to what made the early Roxy Music sound so \"Intriguing\". Notes so \"Lyrical\" they simply evaded being boxed in traditional musical methods. Experimental - just like the man who played them. A man who re-invented the box then left it in the corner, watching it burn. Who was so high he was never able to \"Handle the environment on earth.' Just as his notes rose to Shangrila - so did Simpson. Taking advantage of 'The migration of a flock of wild birds' he left one of the U.K's most influential bands, went through \"A dozen passports\", traveling continents in search of \"The Truth\". Myths and Legends follow this man. A modern Lord Lucan who has left the world somewhat quiet as to the whereabouts of the elusive musical genius. Why did he leave Roxy Music when he did? Did he have stage fright? How does Simpson's story come full circle to the band he once called \"Poxy Music\" - to find redemption through the eyes of the camera of two young guerilla filmmakers? Simpson was a breath away from being a world renowned bass player and leaves a powerful legacy from one seminal album. Mighty seeks to reinstate Graham Simpson to the world renowned bass player he could have been and give him the standing ovation he never got to hear....

But beneath the upbeat exterior lies someone struggling with a host of demons, including long buried curiosities about his now deceased father, and the genesis of his family's increasing dysfunction. After an unanticipated relapse, a frazzled Ethan is sent to Michigan to spend time with his estranged brother, Gabriel, and his wife, Maleena - they themselves still coping with the death of their young son just two-years prior. As Gabriel struggles to forgive and reconnect with his brother, and as Maleena grapples with the idea of having another child, Ethan finds himself befriending their next door neighbor, a famed novelist and professional curmudgeon with little use for people. Enter Elaine, Ethan and Gabriel's mother, the woman at whom most of the family aggression is aimed. When she shows up unannounced, everyone's world is thrust into chaos, deeply held truths come to the surface, and dark family secrets are revealed. It's in this melee of possible catharsis that the Trotter family must finally come face-to-face with the passive-aggressive demons that have haunted their existence for a very long time, and stunted their ability to 'move on' and 'let go'.\n",

They begin by hijacking a gold shipment from the three bandits who took it from the stage. They take it to town and drop it at the bank. The money was the annual payment to the cattlemen, who are excitedly surrounding bank president Sam Leavitt. Steve and the two gunmen who helped him rob the stage are in the crowd. They report this unexpected turn of events to their boss, Big John Morgan. Morgan tries unsuccessfully to pin the original robbery on Duke and his pals. He later confers with Leavitt who is an unwilling tool in the holdups. Morgan tries to decoy Duke, Pancho and Andy out of town while his gang holds up the bank, but Duke, with the help of Leavitt's daughter, Patricia, beats them to it and cleans out the bank himself, taking the money to Leavitt's home to cache. But Morgan, Steve and the gang are in pursuit. Duke Masters and his chums hold up the men who held up the stage, deduct a finder's fee, and deliver the money to the bank. But two men were murdered in the original holdup, and several of the big players in town are in on the robberies, so things aren't all that healthy for Duke and the boys.\n",

David, a colonel serving with Securitatea, is assigned to eradicate the sect. He arrests the leader of the sect and subjects him to a series of sadistic interrogations. During the interrogations, David's mind blurs out. He gets revelations from the World of Darkness, and starts acting as a demon-possessed man. The leader of the sect vanishes. Diagnosed as a madman by a psychiatrist, David is dismissed from Securitatea. Eight years later, David senses the presence of his Master in the surroundings, but cannot locate him. Then, he sees on the news the former leader of the sect, who returned to Romania as a film producer. He's the Master, David has no doubt, the former leader of the sect, now a film producer, is his Master. But, as David was not cursed by God to be a Demon, he gathers the last of his strength and attempts to kill the Master. Consequently, David is arrested and taken by the police to a hospice. As all these unfold, several young women are murdered in Bucharest (the Capital City of Romania), the killings becoming braking news. The psychiatrist who diagnosed David as madman, and - who possesses psychic powers, envisions the next young woman that will be murdered. He calls and leaves a message on her answering machine. The young woman is indeed killed. Looking for clues, the police search the young woman's residence and hear the psychiatrist's message. They talk to him, and the psychiatrist relates David to the murders. The lieutenant in charge with the investigations into the killings knows that David cannot be the killer. David was under surveillance in the hospice at the time the young woman that the psychiatrist tried to prevent was murdered. The lieutenant suspects that they are dealing with a serial killer, as sex was performed on each corpse after the killing. What the lieutenant does not know though, is that the sex acts were videotaped for commercial purpose. David escapes from the hospice, and his daughter is kidnapped. His senses take him to a forest that spreads beyond the city limits, where his Master performs the killing rituals. The Master is the actual killer. He ordered the kidnapping of David's daughter. David's daughter is obviously next on the Master's list, but David's appearance in the forest complicates plans. Eventually, David is asked to perform sex on his own daughter. Instead of having sex with his own daughter, David kills her. Then, he gets killed. Was David cursed by God to be a Demon?

Our story begins in far away India, to be exact: in the port of Calicut, where the youngest son of the most respected spice trader of the Indian west coast lives. His name is Amal. The boy is convinced that Calicut with its colourful streets full of noisy people and lovely smells must be the most wonderful place in the world. So here he leads the happy and unspectacular life of an ordinary 12 year old boy with his parents and his older brothers and sisters. One day, Amal is sent on an important errand to the harbour by his father, to deliver the anticipated spices to some Portuguese businessmen on their ship. On his way, he crosses paths with the old wash-street elephant SOLIMAN, who had recently splashed him with water from head to toe. In the hope for some fun and revenge, he pulls at the elephant's tail as hard as he can. Soliman takes a leap out of sheer fright and stirs up the entire harbour quarter. This results in the entire Portuguese ship's crew noticing this acrobatic elephant. Amal has no idea that this small but resounding gesture sets off his and the elephant's journey to distant and unfamiliar Europe. Now on the other side of the globe, King Philipp of Portugal has decided that he wants an Indian elephant brought to Europe to show his unchallenged power before the people. His deceitful henchman CORTEZ makes use of the fiasco in Calicut and kidnaps Soliman and with him Amal. The Austrian princess Katrina, who is visting Portugal with her family, feels no desire for an arranged marriage with nasty Portuguese heir Miguel and decides to flee from her father, Archduke Maximilian. She not only takes along her snobby pug Franz, but also Soliman and his alleged leader Amal as her travelling companions. The two on the other hand sense their chance to return to India post-haste, which turns out to be an illusion, as they are tracked by the king, the Archduke and their troops. Amal, Katrina, Soliman and Franz run into pirates, star in a play for the common people, prevent a forced marriage and learn a lot about Europe and their people. In the end, this we can reveal, all ends well.\n",

Most surfing historians agree that a single event in 1959 was the catalyst that initiated the surge in the popularity of surfing. This event however was just a spark that ignited a wave of addiction. This event and subsequent surge in the popularity could not have been possible without several critical pre-existing conditions. These conditions and factors included the location, the technology, the culture, the media and the influence of the aerospace industry. After 1959, several key events occurred that influenced the surfing lifestyle and culture. Some of these events where based on media, the surf industry and demographics.
