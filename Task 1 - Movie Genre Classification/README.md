# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification

This machine learning project predicts movie genres based on plot summaries using NLP techniques.

## 📌 Objective
Classify the genre of a movie (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama) from its plot using TF-IDF and classification algorithms.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Dataset
- Movie plot summaries with corresponding genres
- Multi-class classification problem

## 📋 Key Steps
- Text cleaning (stopword removal, lowercase, punctuation removal)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score metrics

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas, Matplotlib

## 📸 Output
- Model accuracy comparisons
- Genre-wise classification reports
